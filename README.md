# Spaceship Titanic Rescue Mission

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with a spacetime anomaly. The goal is to build a predictive model to assist rescue crews in locating and retrieving the missing passengers.

## How to Replicate the Analysis
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Python 3.7+
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - scikit-learn
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
2. **Download the datasets**: Ensure `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and `sample_submission.csv` are in the `data` directory.
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Open and execute the `Spaceship_Titanic_Rescue.ipynb` notebook.
